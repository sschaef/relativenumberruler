Relative Line Number Ruler Eclipse Plugin
========================================

Quick install
-------------

- Go to `https://github.com/thanhhaimai/relativenumberruler/tree/master/plugins` and download the latest binary.

- Put it in to your `eclipse_folder/dropins/plugin`

- Restart Eclipse

- Go to `Windows | Preferences | General | Editors | Text Editors`, and turn off `Show line numbers`

- Profit!

What is this?
-------------

Display a ruler with line number relative to your current line. The current line will have absolute line number. This is useful when you use Vrapper and want a Vim-like environment. You can look at the relative line number and execute vim commands faster, without having to count the lines.
